With solving this problems, I practice working with Methods.

## Problem: Center Point

You are given the coordinates of two points on a Cartesian coordinate system - X1, Y1, X2 and Y2. Create a method that prints the point that is closest to the center of the coordinate system (0, 0) in the format (X, Y). If the points are on a same distance from the center, print only the first one

### Examples:

#### input:
2

4

-1

2

#### output:
(-1, 2)


## Problem: Numbers in Reversed Order

Write a method that prints the digits of a given decimal number in a reversed order.

### Examples:

#### input:
1.1024

#### output:
4201.1

## Problem: Prime Checker
Write a Boolean method IsPrime(n) that check whether a given integer number n is prime.

### Examples:
#### input:
6737626471
#### output:
true

## Problem: Primes in Given Range
Write a method that calculates all prime numbers in given range and returns them as list of integers:
Write a method to print a list of integers. Write a program that enters two integer numbers (each at a separate line) and prints all primes in their range, separated by a comma.

### Examples:
#### input:
100

200
#### output: 
101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199
